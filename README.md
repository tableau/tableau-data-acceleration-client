# Tableau Data Acceleration Client

[![Tableau Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Tableau%20Supported-53bd92.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

## Why the Tableau Data Acceleration Client?

Tableau Server administrators can enable data acceleration for specific workbooks. An accelerated workbook loads faster because Tableau Server pre-computes the workbook's data in a background process. The client is the easiest way to configure data acceleration.

## Prerequisites

To use this tool, you need the following:

* Python 3.5 or later
* Tableau Server version 2020.2 to 2021.4 ***(Data Acceleration deprecated in 2022.1, please use [View Acceleration](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/data_acceleration.htm))***
* [Tableau Server Client (Python)](https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/)
* Server or site administrator permissions
